    <section id="About">
        <p> Laundry is the washing of clothing and other textiles,[1] and, more broadly, their drying and ironing as
            well. Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different
            cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship.

            Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, with the responsibility in most cultures falling to
            women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen). The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized
            solutions to laundry work, notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer. Laundry, like cooking and
            child care, is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.[2]</p>
